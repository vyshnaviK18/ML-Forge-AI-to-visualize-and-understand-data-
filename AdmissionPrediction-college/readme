**Project Name:** Admission Prediction College Application

**Description:**

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting university admissions based on various factors. The model is trained on a CSV dataset and can be used to estimate the likelihood of an applicant being accepted into a specific university.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (optional, only needed if you intend to use the plt module for visualization)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/vyshnaviK18/ML-Forage-AI-to-visulaize/AdmissionPrediction-college.git`
2. Install required libraries using `pip`: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable)

**Usage:**

1. Download or prepare your admissions data CSV file. Ensure it has the same features (columns) as the training data.
2. Run the prediction script: `python predict.py [path_to_your_data.csv]` (replace with your script name and path)
3. The script will output the predicted admission probability for each applicant in the file.

**Data:**

The training data used for this model is not included due to privacy or confidentiality concerns. Please refer to the data source information (if provided) or prepare your own dataset with the same features as the training data.

**Model:**

The model used in this project is [insert model name]. The model's configuration and hyperparameters can be found in the `model.py` script.

**Disclaimer:**

This model is intended for educational and exploratory purposes only. The accuracy of the predictions may not be suitable for real-world applications due to various factors including data limitations and potential biases.

**Contributions:**

We welcome contributions to this project! Please submit pull requests with improvements, bug fixes, or additional features.
